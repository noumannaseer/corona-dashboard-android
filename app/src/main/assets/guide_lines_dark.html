        Dealing with the new Coronavirus: Best practices
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Dealing with the new Coronavirus may seem overwhenlming and
          difficult, but the truth is everyone can contribute to fight
          against this deadly pandemic.There are a few things that we can do
          to help our health care system from collapsing and to protect our
          communities. Below are a few things that you can do to make a
          difference in the lives of people you may not know;
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="subHeading">Social Distancing:</span>
          It adhere to deliberately maintaining a distance of upto 6 feet
          from people in order to stop spreading the virus. This means going
          out to crowded places for pleasure such as restaurants, parks and
          other recreational activities should be avoided at all costs.
          Maintaining social distance will help to show down the spread of
          illness, ultimately protecting lives and reducing the burden on
          the health care system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="subHeading">Self Quarantine:</span> If a person has
          travelled from a place that has confirmed patients of Covid-19, or
          it is possible that he/she has been exposed to the Virus due to an
          infected person around them, it is recommended for them to isolate
          themselves for 15-days at least. The symptoms of Coronavirus can
          be seen within this period. This helps in reducing exposure of
          others to the illness. Once the period of self-quarantine ends, it
          is better to consult the healthcare providers about going back to
          normal routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="subHeading">Isolation:</span> If a person has
          symptoms such as cough, fever or sore throat, then he/she should
          refrain from going out in public, instead staying at home or in a
          healthcare facility and limiting social interaction would be the
          best choice. Special protective equipment and strict
          procedures/protocols are used to take care of patients suffering
          from Covid-19. This will reduce the spread of the disease to
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="subHeading">Flattening the Curve:</span> This refers
          to being careful and taking precautions in order to avoid a lot of
          people conducting the new Coronavirus, so that the helthcare
          system does not collapse; hospitals have beds, supplies and
          availability of doctors to treat patients i.e Flattening the
          Curve. If a huge number of people fall sick, it would be difficult
          for doctors to treat so many patients at the same time, especially
          when treatment of Covid-19 requires numerous protocols and safety
          measures.
